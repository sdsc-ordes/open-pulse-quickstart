# How to participate in the Mini-Hackathon using Renku?

## Renku Workflow

1. Choose your team captain !
2. Each team member makes an account on [RenkuLab](https://renkulab.io/)
3. The team captain copies the [project quickstart](https://renkulab.io/p/open-pulse-hackathon/quickstart) into their renku user profile
4. Captain adds all his team members (renku users) to that project
5. Team sets up their project: add your own code repository and add your own data (Notes: do any code/data connections before launching a work session.)
6. If you want to launch the quickstart session, you will be prompted to enter the connection secrets (see documents).
7. If you want to launch a session with all the code from all connected code repositories, we recommend launching the standard VSCode interface of Renku and working there.

Here are the [Open Pulse Hackathon Renku Project](https://renkulab.io/g/open-pulse-hackathon) and [the template project](https://renkulab.io/p/open-pulse-hackathon/quickstart)from which you can kick off.

For further Jupyter Hub Documentation you can read [here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/);

You can also clone the repository and work locally via the `uv` setup if you prefer. 

## How to submit your project?

Each team will be asked to submit their project through [a simple online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeha3yJF3rxULynG0JnqPsM7d15Qk_6kvaVGmTH3rrDIipA_g/viewform?usp=publish-editor).
We expect every team to prepare:

- One slide presentation summarizing the project’s idea, impact, and main results.
- A link to a code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, or similar).

You’re also welcome to include supplemental material such as:

- Renku projects or workflows
- Deployed web applications or dashboards
- Documentation, datasets, or other resources that support your work

During the final session, all projects will be presented and participants will vote using stickers to recognize the
