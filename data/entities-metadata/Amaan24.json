No email address is provided, and no @epfl.ch domain was found (EMAIL_DOMAIN).\n2. The GitHub bio is empty and does not mention EPFL/SDSC (BIO_MENTION).\n3. The company field lists 'University of Cape Town', not EPFL (COMPANY_FIELD).\n4. The location is 'Cape Town, South Africa', not Lausanne (LOCATION).\n5. No ORCID identifier or employment/affiliation records exist (ORCID_EMPLOYMENT / ORCID_AFFILIATION).\n6. There are no memberships in any EPFL or EPFL-affiliated GitHub organizations (ORGANIZATION_MEMBERSHIP).\n7. No README content or repository metadata refers to EPFL (README_MENTION).\n8. No related organizations or ROR links to EPFL (RELATED_ORGANIZATION).\nSince no positive evidence was found, the cumulative confidence is 0.0, well below the 0.5 threshold, leading to a determination that the user is not related to EPFL.",
