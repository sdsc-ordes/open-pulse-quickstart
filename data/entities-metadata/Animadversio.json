README_MENTION (0.25): The user's profile README explicitly states “Currently, I am working as a Data Engineer at the Swiss Data Science Center at EPFL.” (source: GitHub README). This direct mention of EPFL via the Swiss Data Science Center provides high­-confidence evidence.\n\n2. RELATED_ORGANIZATION (0.25): Enrichment data lists “Swiss Data Science Center” as a related organization. The SDSC is a joint initiative of EPFL and ETH Zürich; references to SDSC are strong evidence of EPFL relationship.\n\n3. RELATED_ORGANIZATION (0.25): Enrichment data also lists “EPFL” itself as a related organization. Being directly related to EPFL in the enrichment metadata is further high­-confidence evidence.\n\nSumming the contributions: 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75. This exceeds the 0.50 threshold, so the user is marked as related to EPFL.",
