Description: The project description ('Light-weight and portable NoSQL database for query-able static content.') contains no mention of EPFL, SDSC, or Swiss Data Science Center.\n3. Website/Blog Domain: The listed blog (http://leandb.prijm.com/) is not on an epfl.ch domain.\n4. Parent Organization: No parentOrganization is listed, and there is no indication of an EPFL or joint EPFL+ETH parent.\n5. ROR/Infoscience: No ROR identifier, nor are any Infoscience (EPFL research repository) entities found.\n6. Location: No location is provided, certainly none in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n7. GitHub Metadata: There are no links to EPFL in the GitHub organization details (no EPFL-related avatar, no README or pinned repositories with EPFL topics, no membership in EPFL GitHub orgs).\n\nWith zero affirmative indicators of EPFL affiliation, the cumulative confidence score is 0.0, well below the 0.5 threshold. Therefore, 'leanDB' is not related to EPFL.",
