Website domain is '.de' (https://nfdi4bioimage.de/) and not an epfl.ch domain.\n5. There is no parentOrganization linking to EPFL or a joint EPFL+ETH initiative.\n6. No ROR ID available indicating any EPFL affiliation.\n7. No Infoscience entities or EPFL publications found for this organization.\n8. No membership in EPFL GitHub organizations by NFDI4BIOIMAGE or its public members.\nSumming all applicable evidence weights yields a total EPFL affiliation confidence of 0.0 (< 0.5).
