Description: 'Tools to support the NIST Adsorption Isotherm Database and Adsorbent Materials Registry' does not mention EPFL, SDSC, or Swiss Data Science Center (weight = 0.0).\n3. GitHub Metadata:\n   - README content is unavailable/null, so no EPFL references (weight = 0.0).\n   - Company field is null (weight = 0.0).\n4. Location: 'Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA' is not Lausanne, Switzerland (weight = 0.0).\n5. Parent Organization: The organization is linked to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S. Dept. of Commerce), not EPFL (weight = 0.0).\n6. Website/Blog: 'adsorption.nist.gov' domain is not an EPFL domain (weight = 0.0).\n7. ROR Data: ROR entry is for NIST (https://ror.org/05xpvk416), not EPFL (weight = 0.0).\n8. Infoscience Entities: None found (weight = 0.0).\n9. GitHub Memberships: No membership in any EPFL GitHub organizations (weight = 0.0).\n\nSumming all contributions yields a total confidence of 0.0. This is well below the 0.5 threshold, thus the organization is not related to EPFL.",
