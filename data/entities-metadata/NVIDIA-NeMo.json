It enables seamless scaling of training (both pretraining and post-training) workloads from single GPU to thousand-node clusters for both 🤗Hugging Face/PyTorch and Megatron models. This GitHub organization includes a suite of libraries and recipe collections to help users train models from end to end. \n\nNeMo Framework is also a part of the NVIDIA NeMo software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle.\n\n## Latest 📣 announcements and 🗣️ discussions \n### 🐳 NeMo AutoModel\n- [10/6/2025][Enabling PyTorch Native Pipeline Parallelism for 🤗 Hugging Face Transformer Models](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/discussions/589)\n- [9/22/2025][Fine-tune Hugging Face Models Instantly with Day-0 Support with NVIDIA NeMo AutoModel](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/discussions/477)\n- [9/18/2025][🚀 NeMo Framework Now Supports Google Gemma 3n: Efficient Multimodal Fine-tuning Made Simple](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/discussions/494)\n\n### 🔬 NeMo RL\n- [10/1/2025][On-policy Distillation](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/discussions/1445)\n- [9/27/2025][FP8 Quantization in NeMo RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/discussions/1216)\n- [8/15/2025][NeMo-RL: Journey of Optimizing Weight Transfer in Large MoE Models by 10x](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/discussions/1189)\n- [7/31/2025][NeMo-RL V0.3: Scalable and Performant Post-training with Nemo-RL via Megatron-Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/discussions/1161)\n- [5/15/2025][Reinforcement Learning with NVIDIA NeMo-RL: Reproducing a DeepScaleR Recipe Using GRPO ](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/discussions/1188)\n\n### 💬 NeMo Speech\n- [8/1/2025][Guide to Fine-tune Nvidia NeMo models with Granary Data](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo/discussions/14758)\n\nMore to come and stay tuned!\n\n## Repo organization under NeMo Framework\n  ![image](/RepoDiagram.png)\n  \n<div align=\"center\">\n  Figure 1.

NeMo Framework Repos\n</div>\n<p></p>\n\n### Some background contexts and motivations\nThe NeMo GitHub Org and its repo collections are created to address the following problems\n* **Need for composability**: The [Previous NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is monolithic and encompasses too many things, making it hard for users to find what they need. Container size is also an issue. Breaking down the Monolithic repo into a series of functional-focused repos to facilitate code discovery.\n* **Need for customizability**: The [Previous NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) uses PyTorch Lighting as the default trainer loop, which provides some out of the box functionality but making it hard to customize. [NeMo Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge), [NeMo AutoModel](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel), and [NeMo RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL) have adopted pytorch native custom loop to improve flexibility and ease of use for developers. \n\n## Documentation\n\nTo learn more about NVIDIA NeMo Framework and all of its component libraries, please refer to the [NeMo Framework User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/overview.html), which includes quick start guide, tutorials, model-specific recipes, best practice guides and performance benchmarks.  \n\n<!--\n## Contribution & Support\n\n- Follow [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Report issues via GitHub Discussions\n- Enterprise support available through NVIDIA AI Enterprise\n-->\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0 licensed with third-party attributions documented in each repository.\n",
