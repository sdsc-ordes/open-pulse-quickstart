PARENT_ORGANIZATION: No parent organization is listed linking to EPFL or a joint EPFL+ETH initiative (0.0).\n4. WEBSITE_DOMAIN: No website or blog URL present, and none on an epfl.ch domain (0.0).\n5. ROR/RELATED_ORGANIZATION: Related organizations include only a U.S. initiative (INIA), none tied to EPFL (0.0).\n6. INFOSCIENCE_ENTITY: No record found in EPFL’s Infoscience repository (0.0).\n7. LOCATION: No location provided, and thus no Lausanne, Switzerland presence (0.0).\n8. README_MENTION: No README content to inspect (0.0).\n9. ORGANIZATION_MEMBERSHIP: Not a member of any EPFL GitHub organization (0.0).\n\nSumming all weighted contributions yields a total confidence score of 0.0, well below the 0.5 threshold for affiliation. Therefore, SCENE: Simons Collaboration on Ecological NEuroscience is not related to EPFL.",
