Website (ReadTheDocs) is not on an epfl.ch domain.\n4. No location information (e.g., Lausanne) is provided.\n5. No parent organization or ROR entry linking to EPFL.\n6. No Infoscience repository entries or related publications from EPFL.\n7. No GitHub membership in EPFL-related organizations or use of an @epfl.ch domain.\nAs a result, the cumulative confidence score remains 0.0, below the 0.5 threshold, so 'relatedToEPFL' is false.",
